# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Towers on Hanoi

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I am making a the game Towers of Hanoi. There are three pegs and a certain number of rings the goal of the game is to get the rings in the same order on the last ring. They start on the first one. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game will have a few things to it. First, the first thing will be to ask how many rings the user wants to play with. Next, I will have it show the most efficient way to solve the game. Then I will also have a print out of the 
game. I will not be using anything fancy. I will do all of these things by using math, logic, functions, and classes.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I hope to accamplish a basic game that will be a simple but robust game. Pretty much what I described earlier.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I have more time I can implement a feature like showcases the uses moves after the win. Or Other things like that.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Things that I hope to do is add a nicer UI.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The first thing that I need to do is learn how to use classes in python. Then I will need to look at the different libraries that I can use to make this game possible. The last thing that I need to do is start coding
and figuring out how im going to design this game. I want to make is efficient.
